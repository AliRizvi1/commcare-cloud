context: |
 Large scale deployments of CommCare require scaling out Kafka brokers to support the high
 traffic volume (as well as for high availability). Up until now CommCare has only
 supported a single broker.
details: This changes updates the CommCare settings to allow specifying multiple brokers.
update_steps: |
 Ensure that you have deployed a version of CommCare later than the version mentioned above.
 To update, run

 ```
 commcare-cloud <env> update-config
 ```

 This may restart services, so it is good to plan for a small blip in uptime.
