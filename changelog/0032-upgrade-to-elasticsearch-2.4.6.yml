context: |
  This change upgrade Elasticsearch from 1.7.6 to 2.4.6 version.
  CommCare HQ releases after April 2, 2020 will not continue to support Elasticsearch 1.7.6,
  so we strongly recommend applying this change before then.

details: |
  As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and
  libraries we have updated Elasticsearch from 1.7.6 to 2.4.6 version.

update_steps: |

  Before you start, make sure that your disk usage is well below 50%,
  or that you have a place to back up to on another disk or remotely.

  0. For commands including `${ENV}` and ${ES_HOST} below to work, make sure to set `ENV` to the name of your environment, and `ES_HOST` to the IP address of one of your ES nodes:
  ```
  ENV=${ENV}
  ES_HOST=$(commcare-cloud ${ENV} lookup elasticsearch:0)
  ```

  1. Stop the site
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} downtime start
  ```

  2. Add the following parameters to your environment's `public.yml`:
  ```
  elasticsearch_version: 2.4.6
  elasticsearch_download_sha256: 5f7e4bb792917bb7ffc2a5f612dfec87416d54563f795d6a70637befef4cfc6f.
  ...
  localsettings:
    ...
    ELASTICSEARCH_MAJOR_VERSION: 2
  ```

  3. Update the local settings
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} update-config
  ```

  4. Disable Elasticsearch shard allocation
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT "${ES_HOST}:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
  {
    "persistent": {
      "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"
    }
  }
  '
  ```

  5. Perform a synced flush
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "${ES_HOST}:9200/_flush/synced?pretty"  # safe to reissue a few times if it fails
  ```

  6. Stop the Monit and Elasticsearch services
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "service monit stop" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "service elasticsearch stop" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  ```

  7. Install and run the new version of Elasticsearch
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} ansible-playbook deploy_stack.yml --limit=elasticsearch --tags=elasticsearch
  ```

  8. Stop the Monit and Elasticsearch services
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "service monit stop" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "service elasticsearch stop" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  ```

  9. Rename the newly created 2.4.6 data directory so it's out of the way, and make a backup of the 1.7.6 data directory, and then move it to the new 2.4.6 data directory location
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "mv /opt/data/elasticsearch-2.4.6 /opt/data/elasticsearch-2.4.6-new-installation" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "cp -r /opt/data/elasticsearch-1.7.6 /opt/data/elasticsearch-1.7.6-backup" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "mv /opt/data/elasticsearch-1.7.6 /opt/data/elasticsearch-2.4.6" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  ```
  10. Verify the permissions and size of the data directory
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "du -ch /opt/data/elasticsearch-2.4.6" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  ```

  11. Start the Monit and Elasticsearch services
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "service monit start" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} run-shell-command all "service elasticsearch start" -b --limit=elasticsearch
  ```

  12. Verify that the cluster status is yellow
  ```bash
  curl -XGET "${ES_HOST}:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"
  ```

  12. Enable the cluster routing
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT "${ES_HOST}:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
  {
    "persistent": {
       "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "all"
    }
  }
  '
  ```

  14. Start the site
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud ${ENV} downtime end
  ```
