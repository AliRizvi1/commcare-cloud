A `commcare-cloud` environment configuration is made up of the following files:

- `app-processes.yml`
- `fab-settings.yml`
- `inventory.ini`
- [`known_hosts`](#known_hosts)
- `meta.yml`
- [`postgresql.yml`](./postgresql_yml)
- `public.yml`
- `vault.yml`


## `known_hosts`
This file is optional and is auto-generated by running
```bash
commcare-cloud <env> update-local-known-hosts
```

For commcare-cloud commands that require opening ssh connections,
this file is used instead of `~/.ssh/known_hosts` where possible.
This allows a team to share a `known_hosts` file that is environment specific,
which has both security (depending on how used) and practical benefits
(each team member does not have to ssh into each machine
and respond `yes` to typical ssh prompt asking whether to trust a given
host based on its fingerprint).
